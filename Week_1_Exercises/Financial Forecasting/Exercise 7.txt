1.Explain the concept of recursion and how it can simplify certain problems.
Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself repeatedly until it reaches a base case that stops the recursion. Recursion can simplify certain problems by breaking them down into smaller sub-problems of the same type.

Recursion simplifies problems by:
-Breaking down complex problems into smaller, more manageable sub-problems
-Allowing for a more intuitive and elegant solution
-Reducing the amount of code needed to solve the problem



2.Discuss the time complexity of your recursive algorithm.
The time complexity of the recursive algorithm is O(n), where n is the number of years. This is because the function calls itself recursively n times.


3.Explain how to optimize the recursive solution to avoid excessive computation?
To optimize the recursive solution, we can use memorization to avoid excessive computation. Memorization involves storing the results of expensive function calls and reusing them when the same inputs occur again.
