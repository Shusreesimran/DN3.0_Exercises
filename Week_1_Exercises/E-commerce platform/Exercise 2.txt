1.Explain Big O notation and how it helps in analyzing algorithms.
Big O Notation
Big O notation is expressed as a function of the input size. It gives an upper bound on the growth rate of the algorithm's running time or memory usage.

Big O Notation Helps in analyzing algorithms in various ways:
1.Compare the efficiency of different algorithms
2.Predict how an algorithm's performance will change as the input size increases
3.Identify potential bottlenecks in an algorithm.


2.Describe the best, average, and worst-case scenarios for search operations.
Best-Case Scenario: The item is found at the first position in the array O(1) for linear search and O(log n) for binary search.
Average-Case Scenario: The item is found at a random position in the array O(n/2) for linear search and O(log n) for binary search.
Worst-Case Scenario: The item is not found in the array O(n) for linear search and O(log n) for binary search.


3.Compare the time complexity of linear and binary search algorithms.
Comparison of time complexity for linear and binary search.
Linear Search: O(n) in best, average, and worst.
Binary Search: O(log n) in best, average, and worst.


4.Discuss which algorithm is more suitable for your platform and why.
Binary search is more suitable for the e-commerce platform because it has a faster time complexity (O(log n)) compared to linear search (O(n)).Hence  binary search can reduce the search time.
