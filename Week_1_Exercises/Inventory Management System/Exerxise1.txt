1.Explain why data structures and algorithms are essential in handling large inventories.
Data structures and algorithms are very much important  in handling large inventories because they enable efficient storage, retrieval, and manipulation of data. A well-designed data structure can reduce the time complexity of operations such as adding, updating, and deleting products, making the system more effective and accessible.


2.Discuss the types of data structures suitable for this problem.
So suitable data structure to be used for this problem is HashMap as we have a unique productid hence using HashMap operations will be easier.
we can also use ArrayList also.

3.Analyze the time complexity of each operation (add, update, delete) in your chosen data structure.
The time complexity of each operations will be.
Add: O(1) on average
Update: O(1) on average
Delete: O(1) on average
Get: O(1) on average

4.Discuss how you can optimize these operations.
To optimise these operations:
Using a good hash function as the data structure to minimize collisions.
Using a load factor to ensure the hash table is not too dense or too sparse.
